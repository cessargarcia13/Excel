# Excel for Data Analysis

## Introduction
In this repository you can find different projects that helped me to learn about Data Analysis, but in this repositorium they will all be focused on Excel (This is not a 101 introduction or tutorial for Excel, you should already know about Excel for this), you can also find files such as dashboards, graphs and databases (.xlsx and.csv) all done with Excel focusing on data analysis.

In each project you can find: 

- The original database in csv
- The dabase with editions that were given
- A Power Point presentation
- You can view Power Point slides as images in the folder    `Diapositivas [Img]`
- You can view the graphics that were made in the folder `Graficas-[Img]`
